		<h2>Improving Photometric Redshift Prediction with Morphological Data in a Decision Tree Framework</h2>
		<p>Developed and validated decision tree-based models to enhance photometric redshift predictions by incorporating morphological galaxy features. Used SDSS DR17 and HSC-SSP data, combining photometric color indices (e.g., u−g, g−r) with structural metrics such as Petrosian radii, axis ratios, and Sérsic-related parameters. Conducted feature importance analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and statistical testing using Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, statsmodels). Incorporating morphology reduced RMS error by ~20%, cut catastrophic mispredictions by nearly 50%, and improved prediction accuracy by up to 10% for well-resolved low-redshift galaxies (z < 0.1). Statistical tests confirmed these gains were significant, demonstrating that morphological features provide reproducible, non-redundant signal for redshift estimation.</p>

      <h2>Dynamic HTS Data Analytics for Accelerated Drug Discovery</h2>
      <p>Modernized high-throughput screening (HTS) workflows for drug discovery by developing scalable data ingestion algorithms and integrating real-time analytics into existing pipelines. Addressing critical bottlenecks due to volume, velocity, and variety of HTS data, the solution enabled rapid identification of "hit" compounds and dynamic experimental adjustment. Leveraging big data frameworks like Hadoop, the project demonstrated that HTS systems can be transformed from batch-oriented to interactive feedback systems. The approach supports multi-terabyte datasets and aligns with pharmaceutical industry priorities to reduce time-to-market for new therapeutics by enabling faster decision-making cycles in drug candidate selection.<p></p>

		<h2>Transfer Learning for Adaptive Navigation</h2>
		<p>Implemented a Deep Q-Network with transfer learning to navigate grid-based environments of escalating complexity. Trained initially in simpler environments, the agent demonstrated significant generalization capacity in novel, obstacle-dense grids. Performance in these environments was benchmarked against an untrained agent, with the trained DQN achieving up to 90% success rates in complex layouts compared to less than 30% for the baseline. Experience replay buffers and target networks stabilized learning, while transfer learning minimized training time in new domains. The work showcases how pretrained agents can be efficiently adapted to unforeseen scenarios.<p></p>

		<h2>Optimal Policy Derivation for Racetrack Completion Using Monte Carlo Control Methods</h2>
		<p>Using off-policy Monte Carlo control, solved the Racetrack problem from Sutton & Barto's canonical reinforcement learning text. Through episodic sampling and policy iteration, an agent learned to maximize long-term rewards while balancing speed and safety in a noisy, grid-based racecourse. Implementing epsilon-greedy exploration and importance sampling, the algorithm converged to an optimal driving policy after ~10,000 episodes. The study validated MC methods’ efficacy in environments with long-term dependencies and stochastic dynamics.</p>

		<h2>Classifying Review Sentiment with Bag-of-Words Features</h2>
		<p>Built a binary sentiment classifier using TF-IDF features extracted from short product and movie reviews. The preprocessing pipeline included contraction expansion, stopword removal, and custom n-gram feature construction. A logistic regression classifier, tuned via cross-validation, achieved 93.6% accuracy on a held-out validation set using optimized regularization (C ≈ 545.6) and the saga solver. Feature dimensionality was capped at 25,000 with min/max document frequency thresholds to balance richness and generalization. This project demonstrates effective text classification under real-world conditions including slang and spelling inconsistencies.</p>

		<h2>Comparative Analysis of On-Policy and Off-Policy Learning Dynamics in a Simple Grid World Environment</h2>
		<p>Through simulations in a simplified three-state GridWorld, contrasted the data efficiency of on-policy (SARSA) and two off-policy value prediction methods using different importance sampling strategies. The analysis revealed that the simplified off-policy method (based on Equations 7.1 and 7.9) achieved comparable accuracy to the more complex formulation (Equations 7.13 and 7.2) but with significantly lower computational cost. Varying learning rates (α) further illustrated the stability-efficiency tradeoff in off-policy algorithms. This study offers nuanced insight into method selection under resource constraints.<p></p>    </p>

		<h2>Logistic Regression for Digit and Image Classification</h2>
		<p>By incrementally increasing solver iterations, evaluated the convergence behavior of a logistic regression model on a digit recognition dataset. Model accuracy rose from 97.0% to 99.0% within the first 10 iterations, with logistic loss decreasing from 0.225 to 0.025. Optimal regularization (C ≈ 0.3162) minimized overfitting while maximizing generalization, with final accuracy at 96.7% on unseen test data. The study also visualized weight dynamics for individual pixels, offering interpretability insights into model learning behavior over time.</p>

		<h2>Comparative Analysis of Reinforcement Learning Strategies: Epsilon-Greedy with Sample Average versus Constant Step-Size in a Non-Stationary, k-Armed Bandit Framework</h2>
		<p>Compared sample-average and constant step-size estimation methods for action-value learning in a non-stationary 10-armed bandit environment. Using ε-greedy action selection (ε = 0.1), the constant step-size method (α = 0.1) significantly outperformed the sample-average method by maintaining better responsiveness to drifting reward distributions. Over 2,000 time steps and 2000 episodes, the constant step-size agent maintained a higher percentage of optimal action selections (more than 80%) compared to the sample-average agent (less than 50%), highlighting its superior adaptability in dynamic environments.</p>

		<h2>Distributed Text Mining and Log Analysis with Hadoop Streaming</h2>
    <p>Leveraged Hadoop streaming to perform large-scale text and log analysis using custom Python mappers and reducers. The first phase involved analyzing Apache server logs to extract the top 5 IPs generating client errors, compute distributions of HTTP request methods, and categorize response status codes into defined classes with percentage breakdowns. Logs were preprocessed, loaded into HDFS, and analyzed via three distinct Hadoop jobs. The second phase focused on sentiment analysis of presidential speeches. After unzipping and extracting .tar.gz speech files, each line was annotated with the corresponding president’s name and uploaded to HDFS. Sentiment valence was computed per president using the AFINN lexicon in a MapReduce workflow, emitting and aggregating word-level sentiment scores across documents. In the third phase, a full TF-IDF pipeline was constructed to rank the most distinctive terms across the ten most recent U.S. presidential inaugural addresses. Texts were cleaned, tokenized, and processed through custom MapReduce stages to calculate term frequencies, document frequencies, and TF-IDF scores. The top 20 ranked terms per speech were extracted to identify semantically significant language. Collectively, this multi-stage project demonstrated scalable natural language processing and log analytics on distributed systems using Hadoop.</p>

		<h2>Customer Segmentation and POS-Based Text Analysis Using PySpark and NLTK</h2>
    <p>Used PySpark to engineer a customer segmentation framework based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics, enabling the classification of retail customers into targeted marketing categories such as “Loyal Customers” and “Big Spenders.” Transactions were processed at scale, RFM scores were percentile-ranked, and customers were segmented accordingly for strategic outreach. In a separate text analysis task, employed NLTK and PySpark to process and annotate over 20 Edgar Allan Poe stories. This involved tokenizing text, performing part-of-speech tagging, and compiling results into a structured PySpark DataFrame, facilitating scalable linguistic analysis and further NLP experimentation.</p>

		<h2>Neural Network from Scratch for Iris Classification</h2>
    <p>This project involved the end-to-end implementation of a feedforward neural network from first principles to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements—without relying on any deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The network architecture consisted of one hidden layer with sigmoid activations and a softmax output layer, trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. Core components were implemented manually, including forward propagation, loss computation (mean squared error and categorical cross-entropy), gradient-based weight updates, and early stopping for regularization.

      The Iris dataset was preprocessed via z-score normalization and one-hot encoding of class labels. The model achieved over 96% accuracy on a held-out test set. Additionally, an interactive prediction interface was built to allow user input of measurements for real-time inference. This project demonstrated a practical understanding of neural network theory and optimization algorithms while reinforcing fundamental machine learning concepts through low-level implementation.</p>
